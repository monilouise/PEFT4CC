Incremental and Offline Just-in-Time Software Defect Prediction and Localization with Pretrained Large Language Models
Forked from https://github.com/ishuoliu/PEFT4CC.

Datasets can be found at https://github.com/monilouise/codeflowlm_jitdl/tree/main/data.

Main additions:
- New models: CodeT5+, CodeReviewer and ModernBERT
- Support for oversampling, skewed oversampling, undersampling
- Support for (IA)3 fine-tuning
- Other additions related to continual/incremental training
- Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL) (attention-based)
